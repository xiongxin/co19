/**
 * @assertion abstract Future catchError(Function onError, {bool test(Object error)})
 * When this completes with an error, test is called with the error's value.
 * If the invocation returns true, onError is called with the error.
 * The result of onError is handled exactly the same as for then's onError.
 * If test returns false, the exception is not handled by onError, but is thrown unmodified,
 * thus forwarding it to f.
 * If test is omitted, it defaults to a function that always returns true.
 * @description Checks that it is a runtime error if onError callback has more
 * than two parameters.
